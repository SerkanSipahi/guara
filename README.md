Guara is collection of Polymer custom components that wrap Bootstrap components, plus some new stuff like &lt;g-table&gt;, &lt;g-excel&gt; and &lt;g-remote-file&gt;

# Getting Started

If you know Polymer, the easiest way to get started is by added guara-elements#master as a bower dependency and incluing guara-elements.html in your index.html.  
If you don't know Polymer, I'm sorry :)
